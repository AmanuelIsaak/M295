## TODO Application

This was a part of our spontaneous Frontend project we did at the end of 4th semester.
The reason being, that we were running out of time. But still it's a humble little project to do ones in a while.
It's written using the Svelte framework. It also saves the todos to the localstorage of the browser.

To run this install:

Node:
````bash
winget install nodejs
sudo apt install nodejs
brew install nodejs
````

And then clone the repo
````bash
git clone https://github.com/AmanuelIsaak/M295/
````

And then finally
````bash
npm i &&  npm run dev
````

If there are any issues regarding node or npm try some of this commands
````bash
npx vite
npm audit fix
`````
